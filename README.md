    Task 7 Optimization Report
    Unfortunately, we did not initially implement our parsers with a naive implementation and test the timings. We
    immediately started to implement our optimization techniques along with developing the parser when we started
    working on the Task 7.

    Optimization Technique 1
    Our first optimization technique was using a in-memory hash table to keep the database's current and added movies,
    stars, and genres. This technique allowed us to eliminate duplicates, preveting the parser from creating insertion
    queries that would insert duplicates. The parser would initially get all the current movies/stars/genres and store
    them into the correspoding HashSet/HashMap. As the parser parses the xml files, it will add the new 
    movies/stars/genres into the HashSet/HashMap to prevent duplicates coming from the same xml file.

    Optimization Technique 2
    Our second optimization technique was writing to a SQL file. This technique although not covered in lectures, seems
    similar to writing to a csv file and using load data. We first thought to write to a csv file then we remembered a
    piazza post (https://piazza.com/class/kmp5a06y7zw243?cid=150) where the entire movie-data.sql file took only 3-4 
    mins to execute all (187k) insertion statements with this technique. Essentially, this is also similar to batch 
    insert except all the insertion statements generated by the parser is one transaction instead of multiple, 
    large transactions.

    Time Total of Parsing
    MoviesParser parsing time + mains243Inserts.sql execution time + mains243Genres.sql execution time = 
    NUMBER + NUMBER + NUMBER = NUMBER1

    StarsParser parsing time + actors63Inserts.sql execution time + =
    NUMBER + NUMBER = NUMBER2

    StarsinMoviesParser parsing time + casts124Inserts.sql execution time = 
    NUMBER + NUMBER = NUMBER3

    Total time = NUMBER1 + NUMBER2 + NUMBER3 = FINALNUMBER
